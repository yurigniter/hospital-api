# hospital-api

These are the spec basic requirements of this api:
- Create a data model in Ruby on Rails to store the personal data for patients in a hospital.
- The api endpoints should allow to:
  - get the personal information of patients
  - create new patients
  - update the patients data etc.
  - delete the patients data
- You would need to store the usual personal information about the patients like name, address etc. but also include data in the model about their medical history.
- There should also be an end point to get the data of when and why the patients visited the hospital e.g. 7-15-2018 headache
- The API should respond to requests in JSON format
- Put code in your project to test the end points by making calls to your new REST api
  - You can use gems like this for that  https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty
